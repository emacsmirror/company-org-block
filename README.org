* company-org-block - a company completion backend for org blocks

[[file:company-org-block.gif]]

When enabled, the character "<" triggers company completion of org blocks.

* Install

Use your preferred way to add /company-org-block/ to /company-backends/.

One way is to add it in an /org-mode-hook/:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'company-org-block)

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (add-to-list (make-local-variable 'company-backends)
                           'company-org-block)))
#+end_src

* Block edit mode /company-org-block-edit-mode/

After block insertion is triggered, you have the option to configure the edit behavior via /company-org-block-edit-mode/.

** 'auto (default)

Automatically edit, no prompt. May seem excessive at first, but I've become heavily reliant on this mode. Give it some time.

** 'prompt

Ask me (via /yes-or-no-p/) after insertion.

** nil

Prefer no editing after insertion? Set to nil.
